Hi, I’m @mattinav444
I have an interest in Psychology, Computer Engineering, and Genocide Studies.
I’m currently learning how to code in R and Python, and also trying to master a bit of Machine Learning.  
My current Research Project is around a software that takes experimental data of common psychological disorders to find commonalities with rarer occuring ones. 

Hopefully this will help to try and relationally associate the common vs. rare, 
so that co-morbidities can be found between the two opposing ones for new data and to have an accurate way of tracking the possibility of a rarer one in a patient. 

ANMORPH is the programs name, and it is in the foundational phases. 
My email is mattinavandyke444@gmail.com, please feel free to contact me there.
